## About <u>minhtran.com</u>

This website serves as my personal project where I proudly exhibit my creations and share valuable insights about myself. Crafted with care, I meticulously designed and developed every aspect of this platform.

### Crafting User Experiences

#### Design Philosophy

Using the versatile tool [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), I sculpted a user-friendly interface that prioritizes simplicity and clarity. By employing ample white space and a muted color palette, I aimed to deliver an experience that's both visually soothing and effortlessly navigable. Upholding the principles of inclusivity, I ensured adherence to top-notch web accessibility standards. Leveraging [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/), I brought my design vision to life, complemented by icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev).

#### Development Mastery

Harnessing the power of **Next.js 14**, I integrated cutting-edge features to enhance performance and functionality:

- [Automatic Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization)
- [Server Action](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/server-action)
- [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/server-components)
- [File System Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages)

### Markdown Rendering

All content is meticulously crafted in markdown and seamlessly rendered during the build process. Employing [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) and [remark-rehype](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-rehype), I ensure a smooth conversion of markdown to HTML. Styles are meticulously applied using [Tailwind CSS Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) and [prose](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/prose).

### Streamlined Infrastructure

Ditching the complexities of CMS, API, and databases, this iteration of the website focuses on efficiency and simplicity. Content is statically generated at build time, minimizing overheads. Previously, I utilized [ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), but transitioned to a static site to streamline operations and costs. Hosting is graciously provided by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), ensuring seamless deployment. Rest assured, the source code remains securely private.

### Seamless Deployment

Powered by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), this website enjoys swift and hassle-free deployment. Leveraging the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download), updates and enhancements are effortlessly pushed live, ensuring a seamless user experience.
